# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves scraping data from Mars-related websites to gather news articles and weather data. The first part focuses on extracting titles and preview text from the Mars News site, while the second part involves collecting and analyzing Mars weather data. The analysis provides insights into temperature patterns and atmospheric conditions on Mars. I was able to scrape the websites and analyze my code with chatgpt. I was able to fully disect the charts that were plotted and get it to read my csv's.
